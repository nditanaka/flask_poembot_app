At Night,Stanley Plumly,""" 'when did I know that I'd have to carry it around
in order to have it when I need it, say in a pocket,

the dark itself not dark enough but needing to be
added to, handful by handful if necessary, until

the way my mother would sit all night in a room
without the lights, smoking, until she disappeared?

Where would she go, because I would go there.
In the morning, nothing but a blanket and all her

absence and the feeling in the air of happiness.
And so much loneliness, a kind of purity of being

and emptiness, no one you are or could ever be,
my mother like another me in another life, gone

where I will go, night now likely dark enough
I can be alone as I've never been alone before.'""",https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/night-6,1939,PP,Afterlife

Waiting for Happiness,Nomi Stone,"""""Dog knows when friend will come home
 because each hour friend's smell pales,
 air paring down the good smell
 with its little diamond. It means I miss you
 O I miss you, how hard it is to wait
 for my happiness, and how good when
 it arrives. Here we are in our bodies,
 ripe as avocados, softer, brightening
 with latencies like a hot, blue core
 of electricity: our ankles knotted to our
 calves by a thread, womb sparking
 with watermelon seeds we swallowed
 as children, the heart again badly hurt, trying

 black silhouette with tall ears rushing
 toward me through the wild radish.

 As it turns out, he's trotted home,
 tracing the route of his trusty urine.
 Now he sprawls on the deep red rug, not dead,
 not stolen by a car on West Cliff Drive.

 Every time I look at him, the wide head
 resting on outstretched paws,
 joy does another lap around the racetrack
 of my heart. Even in sleep
 when I turn over to ease my bad hip,
 I'm suffused with contentment.

And that for you love held no hint of shame;
My eyes caught light from yours, within whose flame
Humor and passion have an equal share.

How many times since then have I not seen
Your great eyes widen when you talk of love,
And darken slowly with a fair desire;
How many times since then your soul has been
Clear to my gaze as curving skies above,
Wearing like them a raiment made of fire.""""",https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/e,1884-1933,JS,Friendship

Books do not comfort, so I get up exhausted and start the day.

To be afraid. Then in the next dream, I cannot see it.
I am sick and afraid. I wake up again.

The Audience,David Welch,"""The new mystery arrived at midnight

Soon, the boy said, I will have for you a proposition.
How will we know, asked his audience, that your proposition is
in proportion to your purpose. You will know, said the boy,
by how many rabbits you find waiting tonight in the woods.
If tonight is a night of rabbits, you will see them in
proportion to the trees. And if the rabbits are proportional,
said the audience, we'll understand the proportions
of your proposition. Yes, said the boy. The audience
dispersed. They went to go wait for the rabbits.
The boy decided he would attend to his new mystery.
Daylight passed and in the twilight the boy experienced
a twitching on the edge of the trees. He called out to his audience

At the meeting of my thighs?

Up from a past that's rooted in pain

my parents scrambled to take me
to massage therapy, deep tissue work,
osteopathy, and soon my crooked spine
unspooled a bit, I could breathe again,

by pain. My mom would tell me to sing
songs to her the whole forty-five minute
drive to Middle Two Rock Road and forty-
five minutes back from physical therapy.
She'd say, even my voice sounded unfettered
by my spine afterward. So I sang and sang,
because I thought she liked it. I never
asked her what she gave up to drive me,
or how her day was before this chore. Today,
at her age, I was driving myself home from yet
another spine appointment, singing along

were born beneath a bad sign,

or boast a lineage of hucksters

you know has been touched

through your life for years

is pulled down by a rope,

for when the people waltz
though the town square, or when
the cinema catches fire,

& film strips blizzard the air,
alive with the faces of the dead,
everyone catching beautiful faces

First Wedding Dance,"Marcelo Hernandez Castillo
","""The music stopped playing years ago
but we're still dancing.

There's your bright skirt scissoring
through the crowd-

our hips tipping the instruments over.

You open me up and walk inside
until you reach a river
where a child is washing her feet.

You aren't sure
if I am the child
or if I am the river.

You throw a stone
and the child wades in to find it.
This is memory.

Let's say the river is too deep
so you turn around and leave
the same way you entered-
spent and unwashed.

It's ok. We are young, and
our gowns are as long as the room.

I told you I always wanted a silk train.

We can both be the bride,
we can both empty our lover.

And there's nothing different about you-
about me-about any of this.
Only that we wish it still hurt, just once.

Like the belts our fathers whipped us with,
not to hurt us but just to make sure we remembered.

Like the cotton ball, dipped in alcohol,
rubbed gently on your arm
moments before the doctor asks you to breathe.'""",https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/first-wedding-dance,2018,KJ,Dance
Experience,Edith Wharton,"""I 

Like Crusoe with the bootless gold we stand 
Upon the desert verge of death, and say: 
""What shall avail the woes of yesterday 
To buy to-morrow's wisdom, in the land 
Whose currency is strange unto our hand? 
In life's small market they had served to pay 
Some late-found rapture, could we but delay 
Till Time hath matched our means to our demand.""

But otherwise Fate wills it, for, behold, 
Our gathered strength of individual pain, 
When Time's long alchemy hath made it gold, 
Dies with us-hoarded all these years in vain, 
Since those that might be heir to it the mould 
Renew, and coin themselves new griefs again. 


II

O Death, we come full-handed to thy gate, 
Rich with strange burden of the mingled years, 
Gains and renunciations, mirth and tears, 
And love's oblivion, and remembering hate, 
Nor know we what compulsion laid such freight 
Upon our souls-and shall our hopes and fears 
Buy nothing of thee, Death? Behold our wares, 
And sell us the one joy for which we wait. 
Had we lived longer, life had such for sale, 
With the last coin of sorrow purchased cheap, 
But now we stand before thy shadowy pale, 
And all our longings lie within thy keep-
Death, can it be the years shall naught avail? 
""Not so"", Death answered, ""they shall purchase sleep.""'""",https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/experience-0,1909,KJ,Afterlife
An Offering,Kathryn Hunt,"""Animals come down through stars

its nose pressed in a rabbit hole.
Two Sandhill cranes as tall as rain,
and listening north. And when a cougar
screams its human scream, I'm suddenly
raked by drumfire blasts, window panes
all gleam and vast, animals angling
through ripe alfalfa fields. My grandmother
holding me to the thunder-headed sky

a body that was once untouched,

off what of this I can. If I dream

Three Foxes by the Edge of the Field at Twilight,Jane Hirshfield,"""One ran,
her nose to the ground,
a rusty shadow
neither hunting nor playing.

One stood; sat; lay down; stood again.

One never moved,
except to turn her head a little as we walked.

Finally we drew too close,
and they vanished.
The woods took them back as if they had never been.

I wish I had thought to put my face to the grass.

But we kept walking,
speaking as strangers do when becoming friends.

There is more and more I tell no one,
strangers nor loves.
This slips into the heart
without hurry, as if it had never been.

And yet, among the trees, something has changed.

Something looks back from the trees,
and knows me for who I am.'""",https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/three-foxes-edge-field-twilight,2015,KJ,Animals

When deep down inside I am terrified
If I ever told you I wasn't scared I lied
Struggling to make it back
To society and my family
I cry
I cry for my son who I barely see
Due to these mountains
And me and his mom's beef
I cry for my siblings who never knew their older brother
Because he stayed in the streets
I cry for my grandma who is now deceased
I cry for my life, half of which they took for me
I cry for my anger and rage
The only emotions I can show in this place
I cry for how we treat each other inside these walls
I cry for the lack of unity we have most of all

Till then all I can do is let these tears flow'""",https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/sometimes-i-cry,2019,KJ,Cities

None wanted to ask what had made

The sun climbed to the mountaintop,
and slid back down the other side.
The black treetops against the sky

And we, the tapering paths of our own mind,
And in each other's dearest ways we stand,
And hiss and hate. And the blind fight the blind.

When it is peace, then we may view again
With new-won eyes each other's truer form
And wonder. Grown more loving-king and warm

Your pipe upon the mantel,-then a bird
Upon the wind-tossed larch began to sing

Eery, distorted, as it long had shone
On white, dead faces tombed in halls of stone.
The whir of motors, stricken through with calls
Of playing boys, floats up at intervals;
But all these noises blur to one long moan.
What quest is worth pursuing? And how strange
That other men still go accustomed ways!
I hate their interest in the things they do.
A spectre-horde repeating without change
An old routine. Alone I know the days
Are still-born, and the world stopped, lacking you.""""",https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/one-who-stays,1925,JM,Loneliness
